Using pandas and python to visualize summary of the ride-sharing data frame by city type and finally create a graph showing weekly fares for the city type

While comparing the ride sharing data for different cities we can observe that the total rides are higher in the urban area and which is proportional to he total drivers are more in the urban area as well and hence the total fares are also on the highest side for the urban drivers and the lowest is for rural area. Also, the average fare per ride is highest for the rural areas the average fare per driver is also on the highest side for the rural areas

# Summary:

Observing the different city types the fares for the rural areas are higher and addressing this issue would help us to increase the drivers as well as the rides to the areas hence increasing the total fare at the same time reducing the average fares. Similar way we can reduce the fare for the suburban areas as well to increase the total fares and reducing the average fare
